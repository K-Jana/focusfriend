It can make it challenging to focus, plan, and prioritize tasks, leading to increased frustration and difficulty in managing overwhelming situations. Heightened emotional sensitivity may result in intensified stress responses, making individuals more susceptible to feelings of frustration and agitation. Under stress, individuals with ADHD may exhibit more impulsive and risk-taking behavior, leading to poor decision-making and exacerbating anxiety levels. Additionally, ADHD-related difficulties in emotional regulation can make it harder to manage stress and anxiety, potentially worsening symptoms and affecting daily functioning. Chronic stress can also have adverse effects on both mental and physical health, further complicating the management of ADHD symptoms."
